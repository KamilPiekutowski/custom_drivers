Raspberry Pi (master) Arduino Uno (slave) SPI communication with WiringPi

In this tutorial I’ll show you how to communicate between a Raspberry Pi 4 (also works with 3, 3B, 3B+) and an Arduino (Uno), using the SPI protocol.

The Raspberry Pi will be configured as a master, and the Arduino as a slave. On Raspberry Pi we’ll use the WiringPi library inside a Cpp code example. More specifically we’ll use the WiringPiSPI sub-part of the library.

The goal of this tutorial is to send a byte from the Raspberry Pi to the Arduino, process this byte, and receive the new value on the Raspberry Pi.

Make sure to read this introduction to WiringPi before if you don’t know the library well.
